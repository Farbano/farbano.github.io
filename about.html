        <h1>The About Page</h1>
        <p>So, the about page, huh. I realized as I'm making this that the homepage should technically be the about page. Oh well.<br> I guess I can use the about page to talk about what I actually study at college.<br></p>
        <p>Well, first of all: The college I go to is FINKI(Faculty of Information Science and Computer Engineering, which that makes it... FISCE, hmm, FINKI sounds better)</p>

        <h1>What do I study @ FINKI?</h1>
        <p>For starters, the program I am attending is Software Engineering and Information Systems(the one in Macedonian, abbreviated as SIIS)</p><br>
        <p>I actually haven't fully decided on what I want to study, which means that I can't tell you which electives I'm going to pick with 100% certainty. I can, however, list some of the ones I'm interested in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>The few related to Web Design(obviously)</span></li>
            <li><span>Artificial Intelligence</span></li>
            <li><span>Machine Learning</span></li>
            <li><span>Video Game Programming(again, obviously)</span></li>
        </ul>
